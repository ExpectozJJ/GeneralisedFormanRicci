# GeneralisedFormanRicci
This code computes the Generalised Forman Ricci Curvature for simplicial complex generated from a given NetworkX graph.
Many thanks to stephenhky and saibalmars for their inspiration in the packages MoguTDA and saibalmars. 
# Partial code was adapted from MoguTDA to import simplicial complex from NetworkX.
