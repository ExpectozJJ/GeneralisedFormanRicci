# GeneralisedFormanRicci
This code computes the Generalised Forman Ricci Curvature for simplicial complex generated from a given point cloud data. The implementation is based on the combinatorial definition of Forman Ricci curvature defined by Robin Forman. 

Many thanks to stephenhky and saibalmars for their packages MoguTDA and GraphRicciCurvature respectively. 
Partial code was modified from MoguTDA for the computation of the boundary matrices.
